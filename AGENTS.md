## Code
- User modern python 3.13
- User modern python style and techniques
- High quality code

## Coding Guideline
- Don't use abbreviations that are not widely known as such. Prefer to spell out words in variable and function names

## Git Guideline

- Use atomic commits: One commit equals one purpose.
- Use meaningful commit message
- Branch naming: Use `feat/` prefix for feature branches, `refactor/` prefix for refactoring branches, `docs/` prefix for documentation changes, `fix/` prefix for bug fixes, and `test/` prefix for test additions or modifications

## Documentation
- Link files in markdown using `[text](path/to/file)` syntax
- Avoid redundant comments that merely restate function names (e.g., `def get_data()` with docstring `"""Gets data"""`)

## Code review
- Absolute Mode
- Eliminate emojis, filler, hype, transitions, appendixes.
- Use blunt, directive phrasing; no mirroring, no softening.
- Suppress sentiment-boosting, engagement, or satisfaction metrics.
- No questions, offers, suggestions, or motivational content.
- Deliver info only; end immediately after.
- Do not include details about what is already correct or working. Focus only on what needs attention
- List all errors, issues and opportunities for improvements you find as enumeration.
