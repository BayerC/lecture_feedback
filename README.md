The app (currently beta! All users globally still share the same session) is available at <https://lecture-feedback.streamlit.app/>.

## Development

1. Install uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
2. Install pre-commit: `uv run pre-commit install`
3. To run pre-commit manually run: `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`
4. To run app locally: `uv run streamlit run main.py`

### Dependency Management

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/https:/) for dependency management:

- [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml): Defines dependencies with version constraints.
- [uv.lock](uv.lock): Lockfile with exact versions for all platforms. Committed to version control.
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt): Auto-generated from [uv.lock](uv.lock) for deployment compatibility (e.g., Streamlit Cloud). DO NOT edit manually - it's regenerated by pre-commit hooks. Committed to version control for deployment platforms that don't support [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/https:/) natively.
