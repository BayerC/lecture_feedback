# Lecture Feedback App

![CI](https://github.com/BayerC/lecture_feedback/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/BayerC/lecture_feedback/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/BayerC/lecture_feedback)

The app is available at <https://lecture-feedback.streamlit.app/>.

## Development

1. Install uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
2. Install pre-commit: `uv run pre-commit install`
3. To run pre-commit manually run: `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`
4. To run app locally: `uv run streamlit run main.py`

### Dependency Management

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/https:/) for dependency management:

- [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml): Defines dependencies with version constraints.
- [uv.lock](uv.lock): Lockfile with exact versions for all platforms. Committed to version control.
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt): Auto-generated from [uv.lock](uv.lock) for deployment compatibility (e.g., Streamlit Cloud). DO NOT edit manually - it's regenerated by pre-commit hooks. Committed to version control for deployment platforms that don't support [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/https:/) natively.

## Relation to existing lecture feedback projects

This is a scalable, tested, and modern rewrite of https://github.com/fastai/fastcups in python using https://streamlit.io/ that supports multiple lecture rooms hosted on the same server.

Other teaching institutions had this idea before, see for example [these](https://www.nwesd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PROL_Colored_Cups_kdj.pdf) and [these](https://www.sstr2.org/Downloads/Cups%20as%20student%20feedback.pdf) instructions.
